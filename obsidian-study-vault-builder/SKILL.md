# Obsidian Study Vault Builder

Build structured, comprehensive Obsidian study vaults from academic course materials using battle-tested patterns for exam preparation.

## When to Use

Build academic study materials in Obsidian for exam prep, creating structured vaults from lecture slides, textbooks, syllabi, and assessments.

## Core Workflow

1. **Analyze** - Read course plan, identify chapters, map outcomes
2. **Structure** - Create standard vault organization
3. **Checkpoint** - Generate Chapter 1, STOP for review, then continue
4. **Quality Check** - Verify all content, structure, format before complete

## Key Patterns

**Mobile-First:** Mermaid + LaTeX only, no plugins
**Checkpoints:** Review after Chapter 1 catches issues early
**Applied Learning:** Scenario-based problems, not memorization
**Systematic Fixes:** Find ALL instances, not just one

See README.md for complete documentation.
